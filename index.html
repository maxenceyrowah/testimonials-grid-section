              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company
              I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I
                enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
            can only say
            wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
            outstanding. It took my learning
            to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
